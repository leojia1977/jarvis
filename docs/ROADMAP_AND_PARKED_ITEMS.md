This file summarizes parked, deferred, and possible future routes. It is a planning aid only. It does not authorize implementation, reopen parked streams, create pilot readiness, or override source governed docs.

## 2. Current Mainline Posture

The current governed mainline outcome is `PARK_AND_WAIT_FOR_PRODUCT_INPUT`.

The human product/governance input for this stage opens only this docs-only governance context model route. It does not open a next implementation scoped ticket or any non-governance product route. Future work requires a separate governed route or ticket with review and human decision.

## 3. Parked And Deferred Items

| Item | Current state | Why parked/deferred | What could reopen it | Prohibited now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ORDIV-L1A | `PARK_LOCAL_VALIDATION_NO_REPORT` | Local validation lineage is parked with no report, no metrics, and no further real-data work. | Separate governed route with Claude Web if report governance, real-data validation, CSV, L1B, evidence retention, or redaction policy is implicated. | ORDIV report creation, metrics, further real-data validation, workbook access/listing/opening/parsing/copying/inspection/summarization/upload/retention, CSV processing, L1B syslog/log parsing. |
| S5-B source/input | `PASS_AND_PARK` | Discovery is accepted and parked; no new source/input gap has been provided. | Explicit S5-B reopen decision with scoped source/input question and review. | Source adapter implementation, source contract freeze, identity/source mapping freeze, real source access, fixture creation/modification. |
| S5-D telemetry | `PASS_AND_PARK` | Discovery is accepted and parked; no new telemetry gap has been provided. | Explicit S5-D reopen decision with scoped telemetry question and review. | Telemetry adapter implementation, telemetry schema/normalization/freshness/provenance freeze, real telemetry handling, evidence retention. |
| Public close-case endpoint | `KEEP_DEFERRED` | Endpoint work remains high risk and was deferred by governed S5-C decisions. | Separate public close-case endpoint route with required review and exact API/runtime scope. | Public endpoint work, new public API endpoints, runtime API/schema contract changes, weakening `KEEP_DEFERRED`. |
| External pilot inputs | `NOT_READY` / `UNKNOWN` | Required input categories remain incomplete in governed repo evidence. | Product/governance supplies governed inputs and evidence-handling rules. | Marking any input `READY`, creating a pilot package, claiming readiness, storing raw customer/operator evidence. |
| External pilot execution | Unauthorized | No governed external pilot decision package or sign-off exists. | Later external pilot decision package, required review, and explicit human GO. | External pilot execution, readiness claims, real customer/operator sign-off, real external-system access. |
| AI_COLLAB | Unchanged | Current stage is not an AI_COLLAB governance route. | Separate AI_COLLAB governance route. | Any AI_COLLAB file modification or behavior change from this stage. |

## 4. Possible Future Routes

Possible future routes require separate human product/governance decision:

- Continue waiting for product input.
- Open a scoped S5-C docs-only ticket if a concrete product need is supplied.
- Revisit external input tracking if product/governance supplies channels or owners.
- Reopen S5-B or S5-D only through explicit governed reopen decisions.
- Open public close-case endpoint route only through a high-risk governed route.
- Open ORDIV report/CSV/L1B route only through required review and explicit authorization.
- Open stream/milestone closeout only when readiness criteria and review triggers are satisfied.
- Open autonomous L3 launch acceleration path only through the governed authorization policy, delegated approver charter, delivery pipeline, L3 critical path, and HOLD queue.

## 5. Autonomous L3 Launch Acceleration Path

The autonomous L3 launch acceleration path is a candidate governed path for controlled customer-trial launch / private launch candidate preparation.

Green/Yellow/Conditional Red authorization can accelerate future stages only after policy activation:

- delegated approver is named
- authorization window is named
- lane and allowed actions are explicit
- required review is satisfied
- full gate and release rules are followed where applicable
- no HOLD remains

Parked items remain parked until explicit governed reopen/approval:

- ORDIV-L1A remains `PARK_LOCAL_VALIDATION_NO_REPORT`.
- S5-B remains `PASS_AND_PARK`.
- S5-D remains `PASS_AND_PARK`.
- Public close-case endpoint remains `KEEP_DEFERRED`.
- External pilot execution remains unauthorized.
- L3 launch execution remains unauthorized.

## 6. Standing Prohibitions

- No implementation is authorized.
- No external pilot input is `READY`.
- No external pilot execution is authorized.
- No S5-B/S5-D/ORDIV/public endpoint/AI_COLLAB route is reopened.
- No evidence retention, storage, replay, deletion, expiry, evidence-pack behavior, or redaction policy freeze is authorized.
- No credentials, tokens, API keys, auth headers, cookies, or secret material may be introduced.
