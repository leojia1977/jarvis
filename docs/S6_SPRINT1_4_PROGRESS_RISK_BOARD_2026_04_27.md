This board is the daily operating view for Sprint 1-4 automation. It classifies every Sprint 1-4 tracker task into one primary state so progress, risk, and remaining automation burn-down can be read quickly.

## 2. Summary Counts

| State | Count | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Done | 27 | Repo implementation or no-code reconciliation is already accepted. |
| Running | 0 | In the active runner queue. |
| Auto-ready | 0 | Can start automatically after an immediate dependency closes. |
| Skeleton-ready | 0 | Authorized for semantic skeleton only if each checklist returns `GO`. |
| Checklist-only | 0 | Authorized for readiness/checklist only; no implementation GO. |
| Needs authority review | 14 | P2/P3 authority, AP/D-02 state, manager/audit, or approval semantics gate. |
| Needs design | 3 | Missing visual frame is the primary blocker. |
| HOLD | 10 | Waiting on upstream dependencies or acceptance prerequisites. |

Total Sprint 1-4 tracker tasks covered: `54`.

## 4. Running

| Ticket | Sprint | Current automation action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _None_ | _N/A_ | Current batch completed through MV-T01 implementation, GS-T05 no-code closeout, CD-T05 source-field map checklist, and CD-T05 implementation. |

## 5. Auto-Ready

| Ticket | Sprint | Unlock condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _None_ | _N/A_ | No auto-ready implementation ticket remains after `CD-T05` closeout. |

## 6. Skeleton-Ready

These tickets may proceed as semantic skeleton work only. Final visual styling and visual PASS remain deferred until the named frames are delivered.

| Ticket | Sprint | Frame / constraint | Skeleton scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _None_ | _N/A_ | Visual skeleton lane exhausted under current staged authorization. |

## 7. Checklist-Only

These tickets are authorized for launch/readiness checklist only. Claude Web authority review has completed for this set, but implementation still requires a later exact checklist result, narrow GO, exact files/tests, and all non-blocking notes closed.

| Ticket | Sprint | Checklist purpose | Claude Web result | Added launch condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _None_ | _N/A_ | Current checklist-only lane is exhausted. | _N/A_ | _N/A_ |

## 8. Needs Authority Review

Primary blocker is P2/P3 authority, AP/D-02 state semantics, manager/audit semantics, or approval controls.

| Ticket | Sprint | Primary blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IN-T03` | Sprint 1 | P2 shortcut approval/close entry depends on later AP CTA semantics; `AP-T10` display mapping is now available but not sufficient. |
| `AP-T03` | Sprint 2 | Approval CTA semantics depend on route and state mapping. |
| `AP-T04` | Sprint 2 | Approve confirm flow depends on AP CTA semantics. |
| `AP-T05` | Sprint 2 | Observe/delay window configuration depends on AP CTA/state semantics. |
| `AP-T06` | Sprint 2 | Observation-window countdown depends on AP window configuration and state sync. |
| `AP-T07` | Sprint 2 | Approved-pending-execution lock depends on state mapping. |
| `AP-T08` | Sprint 2 | Approval audit chain depends on AP route and P2/P3 read boundaries. |
| `AP-T09` | Sprint 2 | Audit empty/unavailable states depend on AP audit chain. |
| `AP-T11` | Sprint 2 | State transition assertions depend on AP implementation tickets. |
| `AP-T12` | Sprint 2 | AP acceptance suite depends on AP route/CTA/audit/state implementation. |
| `MV-T03` | Sprint 3B | Manager deep-link handoff depends on `MV-T01` closeout acceptance. |
| `MV-T04` | Sprint 3B | P3 approval audit summary is patch-gate and P3-authority sensitive. |
| `MV-T05` | Sprint 3B | Manager acceptance depends on MV implementation chain. |
| `SH-T08` | Sprint 3A | P3 approval-audit source/data availability depends on `SH-T05` and `AP-T08`. |

## 9. Needs Design

Primary blocker is visual-frame availability. These are not currently approved for skeleton implementation.

| Ticket | Sprint | Missing frame / dependency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CH-T02` | Sprint 4 | Depends on `CH-T01` and `VF-01`. |
| `SH-T02` | Sprint 3A | Depends on `SH-T01` and `HF-SH-01` / `HF-SH-02` / `VF-08` / `VF-14`. |
| `SH-T06` | Sprint 3A | Depends on `SH-T01` and `HF-SH-02`. |

## 10. HOLD

These should not be started until dependencies close or a later exact checklist changes their state.

| Ticket | Sprint | HOLD reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IN-T06` | Sprint 1 | Depends on `IN-T03` and `IN-T04`. |
| `CD-T06` | Sprint 1 | Checklist HOLD: missing renderable `CLOSED` fixture and `VF-11/VF-12/VF-13` state-header frames; Jira `SCRUM-53` remains not Done. |
| `CD-T07` | Sprint 1 | Depends on `CD-T05` and `CD-T06`. |
| `EP-T06` | Sprint 1 | Depends on `EP-T02`, `EP-T03`, and `EP-T05`. |
| `AP-T02` | Sprint 2 | Checklist HOLD: missing P0 renderable approval context; current AP-T01 P0 branch is not fixture-reachable; Jira `SCRUM-54` remains not Done. |
| `CH-T03` | Sprint 4 | Patch-gate possible; requires a separate isolated checklist after `CH-T01`. |
| `CH-T04` | Sprint 4 | Depends on `CH-T01`, `CH-T02`, and `CH-T03`. |
| `MV-T02` | Sprint 3B | Checklist HOLD: P0/P2 Manager variants require explicit manager authority model; Jira `SCRUM-55` remains not Done. |
| `SH-T04` | Sprint 3A | Depends on `SH-T01`. |
| `SH-T09` | Sprint 3A | Depends on `SH-T01`, `SH-T02`, `SH-T05`, `SH-T06`, `SH-T07`, and `SH-T08`. |

## 11. Daily Readout

Current readout:

```text
Done: 27 / 54
Running: 0
Auto-ready: 0
Skeleton-ready: 0
Checklist-only: 0
Blocked/HOLD/design/authority: 27
```

Active non-tracker automation queue:

```text
docs\S6_12H_LOW_RISK_AUTOMATION_QUEUE_2026_04_27.md
```

Queue purpose:

```text
low-risk checklist / reconciliation / no-code / authority-pack / design-frame request / Jira parity audit only
```

Low-risk queue output:

```text
LR-01 through LR-08 recorded; no implementation opened; no Jira transition performed
```

Recommended next checklist batch for Jarvis review:

```text
AP-T03 authority checklist
CH-T03 patch-gate isolated checklist
SH-T04 search/history scope checklist
MV-T03 deep-link authority checklist
```

Best next automation burn-down path:

```text
Authority input for CD-T06/AP-T02/MV-T02 -> next exact bounded ticket -> safe Jira parity sync
```

Best next risk-reduction path:

```text
Do not start CD-T07 until CD-T06 is accepted; do not implement AP-T02/MV-T02 without renderable authority contexts
```
